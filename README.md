lab for week of 10/1/18
<h1>Explanations</h1>
To determine when overflow occurs, simply examine the value returned.
<br>
A negative sum will be returned when overflow has occurred and two positive numbers are added. 
<br>
A product of zero or a negative product will be returned when overflow has occured for n! where n is positive.
<br><br>
Short sum breaks when n = 256.
<br>
Long sum breaks when n = 475556966.
<br>
Float product breaks when n = 32.
<br>
Double product breaks when n = 32.
<br>
Float and double both round their values, so when dealing with larger decimals, there is rounding error.
