# Lab03
lab for week of 10/1/18
<h1>Explanations</h1>
To determine when overflow occurs, simply examine the value returned.
<br>
A negative sum will be returned when overflow has occurred and two positive numbers are added. 
<br>
A product of zero or a negative product will be returned when overflow has occured for n! where n is positive.
<br><br>
Short sum breaks when n = 256.
<br>
Long sum breaks when n = 475556966.
<br>
Float product breaks when n = 32.
<br>
Double product breaks when n = 32.
<br><br>
Float and double both round their values, so when dealing with larger decimals, there is rounding error when computing (1/n)*n.
<br>
Double can store more precision characters, so it breaks at larger values than float does for the same computation.
<br><br>
(7/8)
<br>
The code using float breaks at the very end. It includes the upper limit of i in its computations instead of stopping before reaching it. When using double it works correctly and does not include the upper limit. This is because of rounding error: float cannot store the values exactly as they are repeating fractions in binary, so does not iterate the correct number of times.
